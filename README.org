* Snake written in Haskell

No idea if this will ever work... at the moment we've got some basic stuff showing on a terminal :|

*** How to run

    - Make sure you've got [[https://www.haskellstack.org/][stack]] installed. Then:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/will-clarke/snake-haskell
cd snake-haskell
stack run
#+END_SRC    


Some notes about how I'm implementing this:
- Worth having two typeclasses - ~Tickable~ & ~Drawable~?

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
class Drawable a where
    coords :: [Coordinates]
    icon :: Char  
  
class Tickable a where
    tick :: a - > a
#+END_SRC
No idea if this is a good idea... We'll find out I guess... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

- [ ] Find out how to get screen dimensions from Brick.
- [ ] Add attributes to make it pretty
- [ ] Don't allow snakes to turn on 180 degrees
- [ ] Allow Food to be eatable
- [ ] Make food increment the score
