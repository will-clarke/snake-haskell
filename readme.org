* Snake written in Haskell

No idea if this will ever work... at the moment we've got some basic stuff showing on a terminal :|

*** How to run

    - Make sure you've got [[https://www.haskellstack.org/][~stack~]] installed. Then:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/will-clarke/snake-haskell
cd snake-haskell
stack run
#+END_SRC
